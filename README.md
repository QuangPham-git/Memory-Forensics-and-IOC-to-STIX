This project demonstrates the process of investigating a Zeus Trojan infection through memory forensics and converting Indicators of Compromise (IOC) from Mandiantâ€™s IOC format to STIX. The steps include identifying malicious processes, analyzing network activity, extracting malware, and using Volatility and Mandiant IOC Editor for forensic analysis. The converted STIX data was visualized using STIXviz.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Volatility: Memory forensics tool used to analyze the Zeus Trojan infection, identify malicious processes, and trace network connections.

Mandiant IOC Editor: A tool used to manage Indicators of Compromise (IOC) and convert them into STIX format for improved cyber threat intelligence.

STIXviz: A visualization tool used to view and interpret the converted STIX data.

VirusTotal: Used to cross-check the malware samples and verify their threats.

IPVoid: A free service to check the reputation of IP addresses involved in malicious activity.
